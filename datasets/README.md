It's well known that data sets shouldn't be uploaded to github.

We include raw dataset zip file at 'raw' folder. It is gitignored, so unzip it when cloning repository.

Zip file can be downloaded directly at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00362/

---------------------------------------------------

In 'preprocessed' folder you can find several datasets used for training and testing.
- HT_Sensor_preprocessed_dataset.zip is the original zip but the metadata file has been modified in order to fix t0 and dt delays.
